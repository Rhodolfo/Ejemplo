********************
*** INSTALLATION ***
********************

Install ssh server
sudo apt-get install openssh-server 

SSH config backup
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults
sudo chmod a-w /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults



*********************
*** CONFIGURATION ***
*********************

Edit the config file 
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Disable password auth for everyone 
PasswordAuthentication no 

Enable password auth for local connections, 
this line should be at the bottom of the config file
Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
	PasswordAuthentication yes

Restart server with either of these
sudo restart ssh
sudo systemctl restart ssh



**************************
*** SSH KEYS ON CLIENT ***
**************************

Go to ~/.ssh or create it, change permissions if necessary
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

Keygen, take note of passphrase
ssh-keygen -t rsa

Your public key will be at 
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub



**************************
*** SSH KEYS ON SERVER ***
**************************

Take the client's public key and copy it to 
~/.ssh/authorized_keys or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 
depending on keygen, rsa is version2.  

You can also create these files
touch authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
touch authorized_keys2
chmod 600 authorized_keys2

And cat a public key to them that has been copied to the host,
cat ../id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2



******************
*** NETWORKING ***
******************

Let's make sure ssh server is running,
sudo service ssh status

Let's make sure port 22 is being listened to,
sudo netstat -anp | grep sshd

Make sure there aren't firewalls in place,
sudo iptables -L | grep ssh
sudo ufw verbose

Now let's also make sure there aren't 
any additional firewalls in place,
nmap -v <host ip>
Port 22 should be shown as open.

Once the local machine has been cleared
and port 22 is not shown as open by nmap, 
you need to check routers and crap, 
add firewall rules to open port 22 to the machines you want.



*******************
*** EXTRA STUFF ***
*******************

To get your public IP
curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/<.*$//'
